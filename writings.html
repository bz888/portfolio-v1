                <h1>Atmosphere Perception</h1>

                <p>‘There is something in the air’, ‘there is something brewing’, ‘a fish out of water’, ‘at home’. “Fundamentally there is no state of life of man that is not already sentimentally tuned into in some way” (Bollnow 1941: 54). As creatures of the earth, it is not possible to exclude the very semantic plasticity of our atmosphere, our environment, our existing surroundings, it serves as a dutiful complexion in our daily operations. In fact, not only do we continuously mention atmospheres, but we illustrate them, we verbalise them, we describe and verify their weight upon our actions. Yet, despite this undoubted importance of the atmosphere, our intimacy with the atmosphere is often regarded as secondary, as we are led to believe the dictators of our actions are none other than ourselves.</p>
                <p class="quote">‘The location of my next coffee date may be important, but my faith in its successfulness is not dependent on the cafe’s atmosphere but my charisma, my words, my charms.’</p>
                <p>However, such a statement is very much of an enigma, there are countless situations where the atmosphere manifests as symbolic.</p>
                <p class="quote">‘She is in awe, she has never had a hot chocolate this great, a delightful memory she holds dear to the location.’</p>
                <p>This vagueness not only confuses and questions the integrity of atmospheric awareness, but also concerns its (atmosphere) existence. Do they (atmosphere) exist independently from the self (subject) or at least from man’s awareness? If so, what extent do they prevail and introject prejudice to the possessive sense of the personal pronoun, manifesting more than the self’s psychological concern. In spite of this vagueness, the atmosphere can not exactly coincide with the subjective nuance. It is true, I become sad</p>
                <p class="quote">‘She has yet to message me back, it has been hours, days past. The aura of my room filled with nothing but the reminisce of her existence.’</p>
                <p>The proximity of that atmosphere has become entangled with my own psychological connection to my room; my state of sadness is doubled, manifesting an external location of sadness. In words of Schmitz (1994:15)</p>
                <p class="quote">Subjects exist only through subjective facts, while subjectivity-for-someone does not already presuppose this someone as a subject. Rather, at its root, in my being affectively involved, subjectivity-for-me is such that the word ‘me’ is to be understood not so much as a pronoun but rather an adverb (like ‘here’ and ‘now’), which does not nominate an object but characterises a milieu - just as with the word ‘here’ we do not refer to an object (‘the here’) but to what is here, in the milieu of maximum proximity.</p>
                <p>Regardless of the external object, space or psychological condition under consideration, the vagueness of the atmosphere can operate on two quite different planes; its significance can be either semantic, through an applied meaning, or it can address the metaphysical status of the external object (semantic or de dicto, metaphysical or de re). Its vagueness can be analogous to any given atmospheric description; its hues, shadows, form, etc.</p>
                <p class="quote">Should solid and contoured bodies be more real than vague entities, which we experience without referring to them as solidity, such as fluids, gas processes or even quasi-things like atmosphere?(Griffero.7)</p>
                <p>In fact, the atmosphere, far from being an abstraction or mere possibilities, preserving their identity in our memory seems to guarantee even the immutable preserved in what is past. Hence, we can say the existences of atmospheres only materialise within the psychological imagery. Needless to say, is the mental imagery enough to conquer the displacement of truth and clarity?</p>
                <p class="quote">There is no attributable affirmity in its analogy, as clarity is not “an absolute value [...] It only represents a form of life, one of the many. For nothing in the world , in the name of clarity, would we renounce obscurity, night, mystery and the intense life palpitating in these phenomena…’ (ibid: 137-138)</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, the vagueness of atmosphere should never be renounced, for one must never exit it. Shall in any case, it is a matter of understanding its properties and learning to remain in it to its correctness, alleviating one's affective reflection without devoiding any critical potentialities.</p>
                <p class="quote">Learning how to relate to atmospheres makes the single man into a member, and critical interpreter, of the world we live in today. (Böhme 2006a: 53)<br><br>...an adequate atmospheric competence (both productive and receptive) could immunise us from the media-emotional manipulation which the aestheticization of politics and social life in the late-capitalist ‘scenic’ economy results in. (Griffero.7)</p>
                <p>In relation to the spectrum of reality, the identity of the real and the perceived, atmospheric perception can only be regarded as an ineffective and anaesthetic perceptive manifold tackled by psychology, fatally confusing.</p>
                <p>How do we initially meet an atmosphere?</p>
                <p>Perception can be considered as ‘if the external world were behind a door and we were in front of it, full of curiosity. Instead, opening an eye is not at all similar to looking through a door lock’.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere fixates the significance of an impression and the psychological memories of one’s situational existence.</p>
                <p class="quote">To have an experience and not the distancing-constructive process that specialised psychology limits itself to, namely not the mere passive reflective registration of a portion of the visual field by an immoblie eye thought of along the model of the camera obscura or the ‘open window’. (Griffero.11)</p>
                <p>If this were to be false ‘we should stop seeing when we close our eyes’, as the optical reduces the perceptive alters, as visual creatures- one may concern this to be the evolutionary outcome of humans, becoming sensorily weaker than other creatures of the earth. In exchange, our bodily evolution became more fixated to the brain and the psychological.</p>
                <p class="quote">The eye comes always ancient to its work, obsessed by its own past and by old and new insinuations of the ear, nose, tongue, fingers, heart and brain. It functions as an instrument self-powered and alone, but as a dutiful member of a complex and capricious organism. Not only how but what it sees is regulated by need and prejudice. It selects, rejects, organises, discriminates, associates, classifies, analyzes, constructs. It does not so much mirror as take and make; and what it takes and makes it sees not bare, as items with attributes, but as things, as food, as people, as enemies, as stars as weapons, Nothing is seen nakedly or naked. (Goodman 1968:7-8)</p>
                <p>This mental imagery and psychological impression, governs our worldly views. As, the perceived world is never raw, but subjected to the self. In order to hear a bare sound we have to listen away from things, divert our ear from them, i.e listen abstractly’. Not only do we always ‘hear the storm whistling in the chimney… but, even when the meaning remains obscure, we do not regress at all to presumed sense-data, because we still refer to the past experience the world has taught us.</p>
                <p class="quote">The physiological process in the sense organs, in the nerve cells and in the ganglia, do not motivate me even if they condition, in my consciousness, psychophysically, the appearances of sense data, apprehensions, and psychic lived experiences. What I do not ‘know’, what does not stand over against me in my lived experiences, in my representing, thinking and acting, as the represented, perceived, remembered, thought, etc., does not ‘determine’ me as a mind. And what is not intentionally included in my experiences, even if unattended or implicit, does not motivate me, not even unconsciously. (Husserl 1990:243)<br><br>An inhibition of familiar sensa is very apt to leave us a prey to vague terros respecting a circumambient world of causal operations. In the dark there are vague presences, doubtfully feared; in the silence, the irresistible causal efficacy of nature presses itself upon us; in the vagueness of the low hum of insects in an August woodland, the inflow into ourselves of feelings from enveloping nature overwhelms usl in dim consciousness of half-sleep, the presentations of sense fade away, and we are left with the vague feeling of influences from vague things around us. (Griffero. 14)</p>
                <p>Yet, it is not necessary here to identify perception with impulse, given after all, it already falls within that common experience that gives us the world phenomenologically, as it is, and which aetiology follows afterwards.</p>
                <p class="quote">We see, hear, smell, touch the world, we use these sensory registrations to understand our surroundings, the world. However, we do not see our own seeing, hear our own hearing, smell our own smelling, taste our own tasting, touch our own touching… Finally, we feel sadness, joy, hope, love, expectation, veneration, hatred, and therefore something that moves the soul, but nonetheless we do not feel our own feelings. (ibid. 290-292)</p>
                <p>We live our experience with sentiment means, consistently combating the truth behind reality and our mental imagery. However, this becomes increasingly complex in the age of digitalisation and visual immersion. If to say our soul mirrored the world, the visual mirrored our reflection of the world… What does that mean? How fatally confusing…</p>

                <h1>Aura</h1>

                <p>In conversation of reproduction, it should come no surprise that Walter Benjamin’s essay ‘The work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’ casts a long shadow over contemporary discussions of new media art. In this widely influential essay, Benjamin disclosed the shift in the function and ontology of art in the age of technological reproduction. He claimed, the mechanical replication and reproduction of objects through methods of photography and film, were the undercurrent responsible for the fundamental metamorphosis of art. Benjamin further emphasised these mechanical reproductive manifolds stripped the unique status of an object, breaking the object’s relationship with its time and space (its aura).</p>
                <p class="quote">“Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence... [determines] the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its existence.” (Benjamin. p.3)</p>
                <p>However, in context to a work of art or any man-made artifact imitation has always been possible. Replicas were common, pupils would reproduce and imatite their master’s art, practice in order to better their own craft. However, the pupils’ replicas manifested their own aura, as these replicas are visually, physically, chronologically different, serving their own existence within time and space. But in the age of technological potentialities, mechanical reproduction discontents with the conventional understanding of replication. For example, the moment a painting is subjected to a camera frame; click, the painting is now duplicated, its uniqueness is instantly destroyed. However, one may argue the moving or still image can only capture a moment of reality, hence the original painting is still preserved, untainted. The reproduction offered by moving and still images are still enjoyed by the naked eye. Extending consideration of Benjamin’s statement, the inherent aura, uniqueness and permanence of an object are closely linked in the latter as are the transitoriness and reproducibility of its original. But, the camera is not just a device to reminisce a moment of time; it is a transmission device that terminates the original, eradicating all its uniqueness and aura. In return the camera bestows the original (the painting) with newfound characteristics, flexible and unbounded, appointing itself (the painting) with a new capacity of mass audience. Similarly, Heidegger addresses this as  ,“the forgetting of being”, a fake. As the newfound characterises of the artwork no longer manifests the same qualities considered as the original, a mere imprint of its former. In the age of the internet and global connectivity, artworks by a particular artist can be easily found with the search box, and a few mouse clicks. The internet not only showcases the transitoriness of the image but its unbounded flexibility and capacity for the mass audience. To give substance to this claim, we must assess the technological integration of the contemporary. Today, we are in consistent access; to a screen, to an image device that holds the portals of reality, to a camera lens, to the mass flux of informational data. This convenience reflects the desire of contemporary masses, ‘to bring things ‘closer’ spatially and humanly, which is just as ardent as their bent toward overcoming the uniqueness of every reality by accepting its reproduction.’ (Benjamin. 5) Therefore, the growth of contemporary connectivity makes it easy to comprehend the decaying of the aura.</p>
                <p class="quote">“Every day the urge grows stronger to get hold of an object at very close range by way of its likeness, its reproduction.” (Benjamin. 5)</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, mechanical reproduction not only concerns the extinction of aura bestowed by objects. But also questions the veracity of all realities. As there are already domains of mechanical reproduction that has already surpassed the perceptive judgments of the naked eye. Perhaps, our desires for reproduction will soon present itself in the path of indistinguishability; where an object’s original is redundant, its aura discarded. At such point, perhaps the reproduced will devient from its services as a fake, and manifest as a replacement for our initially perceived worldly truth.</p>
                <p class="quote">“The adjustment of reality to the masses and of the masses to reality is a process of unlimited scope, as much for thinking as for perception.” (Benjamin. 5)</p>

                <h1>Institutional Critique and After</h1>
                
                <p>Christiane Paul’s essay ‘New Media Art and Institutional Critique: Networks Vs. Institutions’, from the book Institutional Critique and After, remarks the transformation and discontentment confronted by the introduction of new media, notably within the fields of institutional critique. Paul examines the role of new media in challenging the framework traditionally manifested in art institutions, and furthermore assesses various characteristics of new media, focussing strongly on the contemporary relevance of its immaterial nature. This text provides an overall reflection of the new media’s contribution towards the reconfiguration of our participation as the audience and the relationship between the institutional acceptance of new media presentations.</p>
                <p>The wake of new media art is partnered with the infusion and reformation of conventional institutions; museums, galleries, the art market, etc (Paul 193). However, this movement forces predominantly “object-oriented” infrastructures to accommodate the presentation and preservation of new, dematerialized art forms. Its conventional framework fails to support new media works and platforms; thus, a shift from object-orientated culture to a process-driven culture is necessary and transpires (Paul 191). Paul defines this phenomenon as an effect of the inherent characteristics of new media (192). The software, systems and networks posed by new media art is an integral aspect which constitutes in this dematerialisation and “immateriality”. Paul determines that new media art’s strong connection to instruction-based characteristics coincides with movements like Dada, Fluxus, as well as the essential core of conceptual art (193). Much like these movements, new media art places an emphasis on algorithms; the outcome depends on the input into these instructions or sheets of “code” (193). Moreover, new media art manifests a substantial interplay of formal instructions fostering an emphasis on the concept, event and audience participation.</p>
                <p>However, despite the importance of dematerialisation and immateriality within new media art, it would be problematic to ignore the physical and material component that allows the interaction with new media: hardware. Paul addresses the hardware as one of many issues that concerns the presentation of an artwork (194). While immateriality and dematerialisation are integral elements of new media art, it cannot be separated from its material components. But new media’s hardware existence should not be defined as a mere extension of its physical existence, as these immaterial systems cultivate new spaces and network capabilities for further cultural production. Hence, the link between material and immaterial of new media art “needs to be seen against the background of the tensions and connections between the material and immaterial” (Paul 194).</p>
                <p>New media not only questions our understanding of immaterial and material relationships, but also poses as one of the biggest reasons for the reconfiguration of conventional gallery-nexus and art consumption. As, in the age of mechanical reproduction; reproducibility and exhibitionisation become methods; unbounding the artwork from its historical location ("here and now"), rendering it as a part of the global informational circulation. For instance, the camera lens not only reproduces completely identical images but also it reproduces completely different interpretations of identical images. This change in the status of the image correlates directly with the so-called digital revolution. Edmond Couchot:</p>
                <p class="quote">A numerical image is an image composed of small ‘discrete’ fragments or elementary points, to each of which can be attributed whole numerical values that position each of them in a system of spatial coordinates (in general of the Cartesian sort), in two or three dimensions… These numerical values render each fragment an entirely discontinuous and quantified element, distinct from other elements, on which is exercised a total command. The numerical image manifests as a matrix of numbers (a table composed of columns and rows) contained in the memory of a computer and capable of being translated through the form of a video or print image. One can from this point on integrally synthesize an image by furnishing the computer with the matrix of values adequate to each of these points. (Hansen 8)</p>
                <p>If the digital image is an accumulation of discontinuous fragments, then the image can be understood; as a cut into the flux of the real, a package of information independent of its whole, a carrier of information. However, this also puts the physical and aesthetic value of the artwork to a position of unease.</p>
                <p class="quote">In every beautiful painting there is also something non spiritual, merely external, but its spirit speaks to man through its beauty. Worshipping, conversely, is concerned with the work as an object, for it is but a spiritless stupor of the soul… (Benjamin.22)</p>
                <p>Walter Benjamin firmly believes that the enframenet (digital information) will result in the decaying and eradication of an artwork’s "worship value"; its status in rituals, traditions, and its aura (Benjamin.6). The camera, and its image reproduction liberate and separate, leaving the original object lost in reality, unaware of time nor space.</p>
                <p>Unlike Walter Benjamin’s statement Paul considers new media technology as an extension of an artwork’s former self, in the state unbounded information bridging the links between both its hardware and software (Paul.199). However, the heavy reliance of informational influx also births the importance of network and remote connectivity. Paul elucidates the relationship between physical and virtual space through Adrianne Wortzel’s robotic installation Camouflage Town, 2001 (Paul.199). The work consisted of a robot that “lived” in the gallery space of Whitney Museum, its movements and speech were controlled both locally and remotely via an internet platform. The project provided a web page that was able to observe the robot both through the lens of museum surveillance cameras and the robot’s point of view. Hence, Wortzel’s work shared both a global and local presence, however, this does not only challenge the boundaries of the art object, but also represents a new interactive experience for the audience.</p>
                <p>However, this new form of viewership illustrates the disconnect between new media art and gallery-spaces. This is especially evident in the case of Net art, as the viewing of the art object no longer belongs to an isolated space, it can be seen by anyone, anywhere, anytime (Paul. 201). This disrupts and undermines the very logic of museum exhibition and collection, as Paul exemplifies the basic rules of the museum, “Please do not touch the art” (Paul. 198), becomes irrelevant under the alternative space of the internet, the virtual. Coincidentally, Benjamin states that the more contemporary art invests in reproducibility, that is, the less the original work is placed at the centre, the greater the effect it can produce. Therefore, this form of new media art exemplifies the idea of the museum without walls, provoking the notion of “ubiquitous computing” transcending the physical boundaries of the museum space (Paul. 191). Although one may confront the importance of the original and an artwork’s aura, the significance of reproduction has already manifested beyond the artwork itself, as it has become an indispensable cultural agent for art curators to promote the contemporary exhibition.</p>
                <p>Within my practice, understanding the relationship and the impact of both new media and institutional critique are crucial. In the case of Paul’s writing and Benjamin’s essay it has helped me to recognise and understand the current shift from an object-orientated to a process-driven culture, as well as comprehend the discontent depicted within new media art. My practice, especially within the past year, has been fixated on the capabilities and definitions of virtual spaces, along with the layers of “code” and algorithmic instructions that fuel its functionalities. This notion is well integrated and manifested within my current ongoing project, as I continue to explore disparities between the real and the virtual.</p>
